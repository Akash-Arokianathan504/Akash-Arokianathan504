# Hi, I'm Akash 👋

**Data Engineer | AWS | Big Data | Analytics | ML Systems**

I build scalable data pipelines, analytics platforms, and ML-aware systems using cloud-native and big-data technologies.  
My work spans **data engineering, analytics engineering, and applied machine learning**, with a strong focus on performance, reliability, and real-world impact.

## 🚀 What I Do

- Design and build **end-to-end data pipelines** (ingestion → processing → warehouse → analytics)
- Work with **large-scale datasets** using Spark, SQL, Pandas/Polars, and cloud data platforms
- Develop **ML-aware data systems**, including feature pipelines, training workflows, and evaluation
- Focus on **performance, cost optimization, and data quality** in production-like environments

## 🧰 Tech Stack

**Languages**
- Python, SQL, R

**Data Engineering**
- Apache Spark, Airflow, Pandas, Polars

**Cloud & Big Data**
- AWS (S3, EC2, Glue, Redshift), BigQuery, Hadoop, EMR

**Databases & Warehousing**
- Snowflake, PostgreSQL, Hive, NoSQL

**ML & Analytics**
- Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, NumPy

**Tools**
- Git, Docker, Linux, Jupyter, VS Code
